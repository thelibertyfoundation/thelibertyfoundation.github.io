**The _Liberty Foundation_ supports artists who work on the internet by helping them develop their practice into an independent, sustainable business.**

We will open applications for our first fellowship program later this year. Successful applicants will each receive a $60,000 cost of living grant and comprehensive health insurance for the year.

In addition, successful applicants will receive extensive business development support, specifically geared towards developing an independent business as an artist. Classes authored and taught by industry. Classes, talks, materials will be made freely available online, allowing anyone to self-teach themselves the course.

We will be prioritizing awarding our fellowships to a diverse and representative group of artists, working in contemporary fields such as film, podcasts and audio storytelling, comics, music, video games, and tabletop & board games.
